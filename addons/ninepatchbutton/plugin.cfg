name="NinePatchButton"
description="This plugin adds a new type of node that combines the features of the NinePatchRect, the Button, and the TextureButton, with the NinePatchRect being used as the base. We also added a custom sound system to the NinePatchButton, which allows you to assign sounds for some of its functions such as pressing it or hovering over it."
